@poundcake2000,2017-11-03T14:51:52Z,106,"grant, i've been thinking about these videos and i have a couple questions.... last time you fed a nonsense, scrambled image through the network, and it confidently identified it as a 5.  my question is two fold:  1) would any value be added to the network by adding a final neuron that indicates ""no number"" or ""not anything identifiable"" or ""throw this image in the trash can""?  maybe that way the network would sort those trash-type images into a pile for, perhaps, a human to look at.  2) is there any benefit to training your network to get the right answer, but be less confident about it?  you keep mentioning that we want the network to identify a ""2"" as a ""2"" and the goal is a final neuron to light up the ""2"" at 100% (and everything else at 0%).  does this extreme goal perhaps cause really confident misclassifications sometimes (besides the junk image from last video)?  would it be in any way beneficial to train the network to see a ""2"", but perhaps to only be 90% confident about it?  maybe it would *think* it saw a 2, but it's not totally sure - like a young child learning numbers.  (but, being 90% a 2, is still a 2.)  would this help at all with the junk images from the previous question / video?  also, maybe since we train the network to not be so confident all the time, could we then put any image that falls below, say, 75% confidence into another bin for humans to verify?  also, on bb&b you mentioned that it can sometimes feel like too much pressure when people say ""yeah, good video, i can't wait for the next one!""  well, i'll instead say, thanks for this series, and i'll patiently await the next video as you take your time to make it a high quality production like you always do - whenever that happens, i'm good.  no pressure!",True
@13thxenos,2017-11-03T14:45:03Z,13,"nicely done video.  i knew i learned backpropagation before, but it was hard, and i didn't use it manually ( i used frameworks like tensorflow which uses computational graphs and backpropagate automatically) so i've forgotten how it actually worked. but this video is a great resource for newcomers to anns and people like me that have forgotten the theory behind it all. thank you.",True

@3blue1brown,2017-11-03T14:20:15Z,1766,"two things worth adding here:   1) in other resources and in implementations, you'd typically see these formulas in some more compact vectorized form, which carries with it the extra mental burden to parse the hadamard product and to think through why the transpose of the weight matrix is used, but the underlying substance is all the same.  2) backpropagation is really one instance of a more general technique called ""reverse mode differentiation"" to compute derivatives of functions represented in some kind of directed graph form.",True
