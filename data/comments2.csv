@sidneyleejohnson,2024-03-01T19:58:54Z,3,"with all due respect, putin is the worst terrorist in your lifetime. far far far more people have died in ukraine and taken hostage than gaza will ever see. get some perspective! chill. we have to stop putin far more than we have to waste our time and energy ranting about gaza. i'm not excusing the terrorist actions on either side of the gaza conflict, i just think we need to prioritize our allocation of our resources to fight the most substantial risks and threats to the world as we know it.  i love your coverage, but i follow the ukraine/russian conflict daily as well and anytime i see this kind of energy spent fuming about other things  i have to say where are you in getting congress to support aid to ukraine. how many ukrainian children were kidnapped by russia. how much damage has russian done to ukraine? the scale isn't even close to gaza and yet you have the audacity to suggest that the biggest terrorist in your lifetime isn't putin. seriously? to be fair, the cccp spans your ""lifetime"" , its sort of an ongoing terrorist operation that spans decades. there is an online log of how many deaths have occurred at the cccp hands and its not pretty. i think there is a pretty big fight for the biggest terrorist in your lifetime but its hard to pin the cccp actions on a single terrorist. whereas i think its pretty clear that putin's authority is at the fingertips of ukrainian action as well as actions in chechen. between these two fronts, putin's actions make any comparisons to gaza pale in comparison. i get your compassion and willingness to stand up against evil but there is clearly a larger threat. one that has nukes. are the nukes standing in your way of labeling putin a terrorist? recall that the european parliament has already voted russia a terrorist state due to its actions in ukraine. i know you're just mad as hell and its your schtick to say things like he's the biggest x in my lifetime but i really wish you could have taken the millisecond or two to comprehend how many worse terrorists leaders there have been in your lifetime world wide before saying that because it isn't even a close fight.",True
